## Day 11 â€“ Model Tuning & Evaluation

### âœ… Tasks Completed:
- Trained 5 classification models
- Evaluated models with ROC AUC, confusion matrix, F1, precision, recall
- Tuned logistic regression with GridSearchCV
- Best model: Logistic Regression (C=0.1, penalty=L2, solver=lbfgs)
- F1 Score â‰ˆ 0.46

### ðŸ“ˆ Skills Gained:
- Model evaluation (ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Selecting best models based on business and technical goals

### ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
- GridSearchCV automates tuning like nested for-loops
- Confusion matrix shows where model misclassifies
- F1 is key when dealing with class imbalance
