This repository contains all the work I completed during Summer 2025 to build my foundations in Python, data analysis, and introductory machine learning. My goal for this period was simple: learn the basics properly and become comfortable with real data, models, and practical ML workflows before moving on to bigger projects.

This repo covers Weeks 1 to 3 of my self-designed AI Engineering Roadmap.
